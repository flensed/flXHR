/* *******************************************

This example demonstrates a very basic proof-of-concept of how to adapt Prototype framework to use flXHR instead of its 
other XHR (and workaround) methods. The basic concept is that Prototype has a "factory" function which gives it a new XHR 
object to use for each request. If you overwrite the default Prototype method with a function that instead instantiates a 
new flXHR object (or returns an existing reusable one) each time, then Prototype will not know the difference, because 
flXHR is compatible with the native XHR API. This example is by no means a "best practice" on how to integrate 
flXHR with Prototype, as there may be other efficient ways of accomplishing the integration tasks. 

Each successive click of the button will fire off twice as many concurrent requests as the previous click, to demonstrate
how the "instancePooling" feature re-uses previous instances when available.
