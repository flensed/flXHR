<title>flXHR Demo #7f (native XHR)</title>

/* *******************************************

This demo is a proof-of-concept of how the low-level native XHR object in the browser itself can be overwritten with a
a function that instead returns a new flXHR instance. This method is probably the best option if the framework you are
choosing to try and integrate flXHR with is for some reason not able to provide an easy way to override the transport
layer with a flXHR instance. All the framework examples shown previously could have been done like this, but those frameworks
had a slightly more direct (and hopefully better) way of doing the adaptation, so they are probably the better approach.
Use this method shown here at your own risk, as it's a bit more brute force than the others.

Each successive click of the button will fire off twice as many concurrent requests as the previous click, to demonstrate
how the "instancePooling" feature re-uses previous instances when available.
