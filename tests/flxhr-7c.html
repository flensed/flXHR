/* *******************************************

This example demonstrates a very basic proof-of-concept of how to adapt YUI framework to use flXHR instead of its 
other XHR (and workaround) methods. The basic concept is that YUI has a "factory" function which gives it a new XHR 
object to use for each request. If you overwrite the default YUI method with a function that instead instantiates a 
new flXHR object (or returns an existing reusable one) each time, then YUI will not know the difference, because 
flXHR is compatible with the native XHR API. This example is by no means a "best practice" on how to integrate 
flXHR with YUI, as there may be other efficient ways of accomplishing the integration tasks. 

Each successive click of the button will fire off twice as many concurrent requests as the previous click, to demonstrate
how the "instancePooling" feature re-uses previous instances when available.
